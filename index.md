## Brain Health Assessment & TabCAT

**Brain Health Assessment** is a tablet-based cognitive testing tool on an iOS-operating system called [**TabCAT**](https://memory.ucsf.edu/research-trials/professional/tabcat) (Tablet-based Cognitive Assessment Tool). It was developed by the team at [UCSF Memory and Aging Center, San Francisco, USA](https://memory.ucsf.edu).

BHA consists of 4 subtests assessing different functions of the brain. **Favorites** is a memory task; **Match** is an executive and psychomotor speed task; **Line Orientation** is a task measuring visuospatial skills; and **Brain Health Survey (BHS)** is a set of informant-based questionnaires.

## Thai TabCAT

[Dr Suchanan Kanjanapong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suchanan-kanjanapong-a16624a5/) spent her year during a [Prince Mahidol Award Youth Program Scholarship](https://www.princemahidolaward.org/the-result-of-the-prince-mahidol-award-youth-program-scholarship-recipients-2017/) period under supervision of [Associate Professor Katherine Possin](https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/katherine-possin-phd) at the [Memory and Aging Center, UCSF](https://memory.ucsf.edu) working on a Thai version of the tablet-based cognitive testing tool, called Thai **TabCAT**.

**Thai Brain Health Assessment** is now undergoing the validation process to assess accuracy in Thai older adults with the geriatric neuropsychology team led by [Professor Weerasak Muangpaisan](https://www.si.mahidol.ac.th/th/department/preventive/dept_person_detail.asp?ps_id=256) at [Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University](https://www2.si.mahidol.ac.th/en/).
